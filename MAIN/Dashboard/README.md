So first of all, I coded all of this by myself with LuaRT because I was bored. It works not quite good, but it works!
The main.lua is the Main file, wich means if you open this file with LuaRT, you get everything to use the Dashboard.
The Dashboard is not quite a Dashboard, but I dont know what else I should call it.

Sorry if some Text in the Dashboard is on German. I will probably make 2 versions but not yet.

I hope you can do something with that. You can also give some tips to improve it on my Discord profile: labikistan#7288

Have a great day.
